# BankingApp
The banking app with a twist

# Description of the project
- i create programs from my personal experience. that is i face a problem and think of ways to tackle that problem using technology.
- we live in the credit world. and many people have accounts and you are required to pay back something at the end of every month.
- the above is no problem to people that are working in corparate or government because on specific days they get their money.
- but what about the street lovers like me, we do not have a fixed income like those in corporate or governmnet.
- we get money at any time.
- so if the instalment date is set for last day of the month, and is on debicheck, that is the system set by the bank and service provider.
- so sometimes when you get that money, you pay early, you run the risk of being double charged because it seems like the system cannot pick
  that you paid
- i want to create an application whereby you deposit into certain account within your bank account. it locks that money till the last day of the month and then release that money to the main account or relevant account. this will help keep the clients name clear , that is the ability to pay within stipulated dates.
- credit is everything to the entrepreneur

# Cooking tools
- for this project, i am going to use Python language. the language i am most comfortable with.
